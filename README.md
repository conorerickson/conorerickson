UPDATE: So sorry that my commits have slowed to a stop, I am currently going through classes to learn Java and have not begun any projects using it as I am reviewing the concepts from scratch. I will be active again in the coming weeks. Thank you for viewing my profile and stay tuned for Java and Kotlin repos!
